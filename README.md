#ChUI

##Builds Apps with ChocolateChip-UI

This is a package to enable you to create ChocolateChip-UI projects. Depending on the parameters you provide, ChUI can create a hybrid app or a standalone Web app. If you choose to make a hybrid app, ChUI will create a project for  Android Studio into which you can drag your completed ChocolateChip-UI Web app.
